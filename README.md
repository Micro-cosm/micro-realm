# MicroRealm

# This project has moved to: [micro-mifedom](https://github.com/Micro-cosm/micro-mifedom)

_A fully configured base Firebase configuration that serves as the controller for a robust, albeit simplistic, micro-frontend(aka **miffy**) architecture.
Because our of the shared common purpose, **we are quick to respond to your hackathon needs... your win IS our win!**_

----

This sole purpose of this repo is to coordinate the fledgling Micro-cosm project and serves as just an example of how one might leverage
the Firebase platform to create a cohesive, yet loosely-coupled, set of miffies.  This assumes you have enabled the firebase cli for access to
your own GCP project. 

This project is optimized for the quick enablement and discovery of new ideas.  Thus far, minimal security
and performance consideration has been applied.  Although suggestions will be sprinkled throughout the project
to address such concerns and others, it is really beyond the scope of the overarching project and deserves a level
of attention appropriate to your use.  **Please use freely, but at your own risk.**
